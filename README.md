## How the journey start

I started my coding journey back in **July 2019** with some **FREE** online resources such as [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) & [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). I learned the basics of **Html, CSS & JavaScript** 👨🏻‍💻

``` js
console.log("Hello World!")
```

After 2 months of self-taught learning, I enrolled in a four-month training bootcamp where I learned **Java, Servlet & JSP, SQL, and the basics of Computer Science**.

I also did a [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge that really level up my skills. You can check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jacoblindev/) for what I did.

After 9 months of hard work, at **April 2020** I finally landed my first developer job 🎉 and successfully switch my career from Architectural Designer to Web Developer.

Here's some more free resources I recommended to start your journey:

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
- [The Ordin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/)

## How it's going so far

### Slow but steady on the right track... I think 🤔

Fast forward to now, I'm currently working as a backend engineer & focusing on mastering some frameworks & tools to boost up my skills...! Such as:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [GCP - Associate Cloud Engineer](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/11)

Though I'm working as a backend engineer, but I consider myself as a full-stack engineer because I'm kinda all over the places...! 🤣
