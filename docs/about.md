# :wave: Hi

::: info Here's my journey so far...

> I used to design buildings..., now I build websites. :wink:

I started my coding journey back in July 2019 with free online resources such as [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) & [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). I learned the basics of **Html, CSS & JavaScript** `> Hello World!` :technologist:

Then I enrolled in a four-month government-funded training program where I learned **Java, Servlet & JSP, SQL, and the basics of Computer Science**.

I also did a [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge that really level up my skills. You can check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jacoblindev/) for what I did.

After 9 months of hard work, I finally landed my first developer job :tada: and successfully switch my career from Designer to Developer. Fast forward to now, I'm currently focusing on mastering some frameworks to boost up my skills...

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) for frontend
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) for backend
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for cross-platform apps

Here's some more free resources I recommended to start your journey:

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
- [The Ordin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
